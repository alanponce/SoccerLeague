Hello World!

* Tema 1 : Introducción a tecnologías de aplicaciones web

	In this demo, you show students how to start the Application Server, view the
server log file, and access the Application Server Admin console from the
NetBeans IDE.

* Tema 2 : Desarrollo de componentes visuales

	In this demo, you show students how to use the NetBeans IDE do the following:

1. Create a web application project.

2. Create a servlet and verify the servlet configuration.

3. Create an HTML page.

4. Build and deploy the web application.


A ViewDemo project is also provided in this directory. This project is a
NetBean project-ized version of the Soccer League example discussed in the
Student guide. other than creating a web application project, you can open the
project, and demonstrate how to do everything else, for example, creating a
new servlet, creating an HTML page, setting the welcome page, building and
deploying the web application.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer

In this demo, only the list all leagues link works.

 - Files :  /trunk/SoccerLeague/WebContent/index.html
 			/trunk/SoccerLeague/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml
 			/trunk/SoccerLeague/src/sl314/model/League.java
 			/trunk/SoccerLeague/src/sl314/view/ListLeaguesServlet.java
 			
* Tema 3 : Desarrollo de componentes controladores

	In this demo, you use the ControllerDemo project to demonstrate the soccer
league sample web application and explain the following:

1. Use the add_league.html to demonstrate the creation of the HTMl form.

2. Use the sl314.controller.AddLeagueServlet to demonstrate a simple
   implementation of a controller, including the input validation, and
   executing business logic, and request dispatch.

3. Use the web.xml to demonstrate the servlet configuration.

4. Use sl314.view.SuccessServlet to demonstrate how to retrieve an attribute
   from the request scope.

5. Use sl314.view.ErrorPageServlet to demonstrate how to manually render
   validation errors.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer

Just like the exercise, when you click add league, the league is not added
to the list yet. This part will be implemented in future exercises.
